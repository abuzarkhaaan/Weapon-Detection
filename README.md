# Weapon Detection with YOLOv8

This repository contains the YOLOv8 model weights and code for testing a weapon detection system. YOLOv8 is the latest evolution of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, designed for high-performance, real-time object detection. This model is specifically trained to detect weapons such as guns, knives, and other potentially harmful objects, making it ideal for surveillance, safety monitoring, and threat detection applications.

## Features
- **YOLOv8 Model Weights**: Pre-trained weights optimized for weapon detection.
- **Testing Script**: Python script for testing the model on custom images or video feeds.
- **High Accuracy & Speed**: Enhanced accuracy and real-time detection for safety-critical applications.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple instructions to load the model and test its performance.
